\section*{Problems from 1.2}
\begin{description}
    \item[6] Let $L$ be any language on a non-empty alphabet. Show that $L$ and
          $\overline{L}$ cannot both be finite.

    \item[7] Are there language for which $\overline{L^*} = (\overline{L})^*$?
\end{description}

\subsection*{Additional Problems}
For the additional problems, describe via an English sentence each of
the languages from the following Exercises in Section 1.2.

\begin{description}
    \item[14(b)] Let $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$. For each of the following
                 languages, find a grammar that generates it.

                 $L_2 = \{a^n b^{2n} : n \ge 0\}$.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[15(a)] Find grammars for the following languages on $\Sigma = \{a\}$.

                 $L = \{w : |w|\, \mathrm{mod}\, 3 = 0\}.$
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[18(b,d)]
        Using the notation from Example 1.13:
        \begin{eqnarray*}
          S \to& aA, \\
          A \to& bS,\\
          S \to& \lambda
        \end{eqnarray*}

        find grammars for the languages below. Assume $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$.

        (b) $L = \{w : n_a (w) = n_b (w) + 1\}$.

        (d) $L = \{w \in \{a, b\}^* : |n_a(w) - n_b(w)| = 1\}$.
\end{description}

% Section 2.1: 2(d), 7(c), 9(c), 12, 17 (see hint 1 below)
%
% Hint 1: We know that L is regular. Thus there is a DFA M such that
%         L=L(M). To solve this problem you need to describe how to form
%         a new DFA M' from M such that L(M')=L-{lambda}. You can
%         construct such an M' by adding a single state to M with the
%         appropriate arcs. You need to provide an informal argument as
%         to why your construction is correct.
\section*{Problems from 2.1}

\begin{description}
    \item[2(d)] For $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$. construct dfa's that accept the
                sets containing of all strings with at least one $a$ and
                exactly two $b$'s.
\end{description}


\begin{description}
    \item[7(c)] Find dfa's for the following languages on $\Sigma = {a, b}$.

                $L = \{w : |w|\, \mathrm{mod}\, 3 > 1\}$.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[9(c)] Consider the set of strings on $\{0, 1\}$ defined by the
                requirements below.  For each, construct an accepting dfa.

                The leftmost symbol differs from the rightmost one.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[12] Show that $L = \{a^n : n \ge 4\}$ is regular.

    \item[17] Show that if $L$ is regular, so is $L - \{\lambda\}$.\\
              \emph{Hint}: We know that $L$ is regular. Thus there is a
              DFA $M$ such that $L = L(M)$. To solve this problem you
              need to describe how to form a new DFA $M'$ from $M$ such
              that $L(M') = L - \{\lambda\}$.  You can construct such an
              $M'$ by adding a single state to $M$ with the appropriate
              arcs. You need to provide an informal argument as to why
              your construction is correct.
