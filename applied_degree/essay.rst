Introduction
------------

I love telling people that the reason I came to Oregon State University
was to create open source software. As soon as I was enrolled, I did
everything in my power to get a job at Oregon State University's Open
Source Lab (OSUOSL). This led me to become a core contributor to the
Ganeti Web Manager (GWM) project at the OSUOSL.

Knowing that Oregon State had such a strong interest in open source
software made me excited to be a student here, but  when I learned that
the university's interest in open source wasn't as strong as I realized,
I was dismayed; Oregon State University doesn't have an open source
degree.

That is why I have created this plan for a Bachelor of Science in
Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) Development. This degree will
provide me with the skills to communicate well with other cultures,
quickly resolve disputes, and solve problems with a small group of
developers.

I first began noticing the need for these specific communication skills
during my first summer at the OSUOSL. A Polish student starting working
on GWM as part of Google Code-In.  Communication between him and the
lead developer was challenging due to cultural differences. If I had
learned how to communicate well with people from other cultures by
taking a class such as COMM 326, I could have offered my help as a
intermediary. 

A second example of when communication skills could have greatly helped
me with the GWM project is when we released version 0.5.  At that time
The Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET) withdrew their
contributions and began working on their own version of GWM because
there was a conflict between their team and ours over the implementation
of the caching subsystem. They left because a compromise wasn't reached.
If I had taken a class on bargaining or negotiation, such as COMM 442, I
might have been able to negotiate a compromise between our teams that
could have quickly resolved the dispute, and enabled us to continue to
benefit from their support.

The last example I have for why these communication skills are so
important for FLOSS Development comes from recent experience. 
When I first came to the OSUOSL most of my time was spent
working alone, but since we have hired on more students I have begun
working more with other developers in a small group. Because most of my
experience with creating software has been by myself, I really don't
have the skills needed to work well with others in a small group. Thats
why small group problem solving, such as what is taught in COMM 322, is
a key skill to have in FLOSS Development.

----------
Conclusion
----------
Intercultural communication, conflict resolution, and small group
problem solving are all skills not currently taught within the Computer
Science curriculum. Yet all of these skills are very much needed by
FLOSS developers. That is why an Applied Computer Science degree in
FLOSS Development should be focused on acquiring a depth of
communication skills, and why you should accept my proposal.
