Introduction

I love telling people that the reason I came to Oregon State Univerity
was to create open source software. As soon as I was enrolled, I did
everything in my power to get a job at Oregon State University's Open
Source Lab. This led me to become a core contributor to the Ganeti Web
Manager project at the OSUOSL.

Knowing that Oregon State had such a strong interest in open source
software made me excited to be a student here, but  when I learned that
the university's interest in open source wasn't as strong as I realized,
I was dismayed; Oregon State University doesn't have an open source
degree.

That is why I have created this plan for a Bachelor of Science in
Free/Open Source Software Development. A degree which will provide me
with the skills to communicate well with other cultures, quickly resolve
disputes, and solve problems with a small group of developers.

During my first summer at the OSUOSL, there was a Google Code-In student
from Poland helping out on Ganeti Web Manager. Communicating back and
forth was challenging with the student because of the language barrier.
I'm sure our
communication would have been much easier or I would have had the
skills to help smooth it out. Either way it would enable me to
communicate well with other cultures.


- COMM 440 theories of conflict and conflict management

Open source project generally contain conflicts and differing opinions
of implementation or importance of a feature. grnet did not agree with
the choice of caching objects, and wanted the feature to be optional. We
disagreed. There was no compromise. grnet 'took their ball and left'
forking from GWM at 0.5. If I had better communication skills I could
have worked as an intermediary between grnet and the developers on the
issue. 

- COMM 322 small-group problem solving 
- manage small group of developers

Recently at the OSUOSL I transfered over to being a dev-op because I
felt I didn't know enough about systems to 


All of these skills are not taught in the current Computer Science
curriculum. 

This is why I feel an Applied Computer Science degree in Open Source 
Development should be focused on acquiring a depth of communication 
skills.
