Introduction

A degree in FOSS Development would provide me with the skills to
communicate well with other cultures, resolve disputes quickly, and
manage a small group of developers effectively.

- communicate well with other cultures

Open Source development is done over the internet between people of
varying cultural backgrounds. The first summer working on GWM the OSL
participated in Google Code-In. One of our main contributers from the
program was pbnan from Poland. It was not easy communicating back and
forth about what we expected from the issues and what he had done. If I
had a background in communication, we could have better explained our
expectation to someone from another culture.

- resolve disputes effectively

Open source project generally contain conflicts and differing opinions
of implementation or importance of a feature. grnet did not agree with
the choice of caching objects, and wanted the feature to be optional. We
disagreed. There was no compromise. grnet 'took their ball and left'
forking from GWM at 0.5. If I had better communication skills I could
have worked as an intermediary between grnet and the developers on the
issue. 

- manage small group of developers

A very common trend in open source software is that the development is
done by a small group of dedicated volunteers. In order for that group
to work well together though, they need a leader who is able to resolve
internal disputes and keep things on track.

Conclusion
----------

All of these skills are not taught in the current Computer Science
curriculum. 

----------

Communication takes up a large portion of the open source development 
process.

Though communication is key to other disciplines as well, open source 
development is unique in that most of the communication is
conducted online across cultural boundries.

This is why I feel an Applied Computer Science degree in Open Source 
Development should be focused on acquiring a depth of communication 
skills.
