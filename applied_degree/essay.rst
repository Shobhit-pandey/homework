Introduction

I love telling people that the reason I came to Oregon State Univerity
was to create open source software. As soon as I was enrolled, I did
everything in my power to get a job at Oregon State University's Open
Source Lab. This led me to become a core contributor to the Ganeti Web
Manager project at the OSUOSL.

Knowing that Oregon State had such a strong interest in open source
software made me excited to be a student here, but  when I learned that
the university's interest in open source wasn't as strong as I realized,
I was dismayed; Oregon State University doesn't have an open source
degree.

That is why I have created this plan for a Bachelor of Science in
Free/Open Source Software Development. A degree which will provide me
with the skills to communicate well with other cultures, quickly resolve
disputes, and solve problems with a small group of developers.

During my first summer at the OSUOSL, there was a Google Code-In student
from Poland helping out on Ganeti Web Manager. Communicating back and
forth was challenging with the student because of the language barrier.
I'm sure our
communication would have been much easier or I would have had the
skills to help smooth it out. Either way it would enable me to
communicate well with other cultures.

Around version 0.5 of Ganeti Web Manager, GRNET (The Greek Research and
Technology Network) withdrew their contributions and began working on
their own version of Ganeti Web Manager. This was due to a conflict
between our team and theirs over a feature implementation. They left
because a compromise wasn't reached. If I had taken a class like COMM
440, I'm sure I would have been much more helpful in finding a
compromise that both our teams could have agreed upon.

Recently at the OSUOSL I transfered over to being a dev-op because I
felt I didn't know enough about systems to 


All of these skills are not taught in the current Computer Science
curriculum. 

This is why I feel an Applied Computer Science degree in Open Source 
Development should be focused on acquiring a depth of communication 
skills.
