Open source is a major force in the IT community, and something most of us use
on a daily basis. It has often been described as being software that is "Free
as in freedom, not as in beer". In this assignment, explain what is meant by
that expression, and what open source is and is not in terms of intellectual
property. What right can open source developers retain and not retain if they
release their code under an OSI approved license? List and explain the key
licensing terms of the most common OSI licenses (e.g what is copy left?), and
what it means to have a GPL compatible license. 

5-6 pages. Remember to cite your sources.

Please hand in a hard-copy of your paper in class on the due date. Any
assignments turned in after that will be marked down 10 points every day late.
