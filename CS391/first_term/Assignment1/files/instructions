Assignment 1:

Last years events in Egypt have been called the Facebook revolution in that
social media was (supposedly?) instrumental in not just organizing,

getting word out to the rest of the world to keep pressure on the regime. 

Give a brief chronology of the events, especially as they relate to
technology and tech companies (~2 pages). Make sure to identify the main
technology actors and their actions (supporting or undermining). Make sure to
cite your sources

Pick, and clearly identify a "workable" ethical framework (See
definition in textbook) suitable for analyzing the morality of the governments
actions, and the actions of one of the main tech companies.

analysis

Argue the morality of the 2 actors key decisions based on this
ethical framework

Write this analysis up as a 5-6 page report, single spaced, 12pt
times new roman, normal margin pages.
