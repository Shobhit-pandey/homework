Essay for Chapter 2
-------------------
Many of you probably don't have experience with ethical theory, so this
first essay will have a different twist. Instead of writing about the
material in the chapter (ethical theory), I want you use one
consequentialist theory (Utilitarianism, Rule or Act) and one
non-consequentialist theory (Kantianism or Social Contract Theory) to
explore the ethical implications of a personal experience or current
event and decide if what happened was morally justified. Then you need
to find and cite support evidence for your moral dilemma--this does NOT
need to prove or disprove your issue; it's meant to further your
critical perspective on the issue you have chosen. Refer to the essay
criterion document in Course Information for what qualifies as suitable
support evidence.

Although you can write about a personal experience OR a current event,
personal experience is preferred.

*Warning*
You cannot reuse a topic so choose wisely here--might help to
scan the chapters for ideas, remembering that you are unable to use
subject matter twice.

Be sure to follow the formatting guidelines (500 - 750 words, double
spaced, etc.); refer to the essay criterion document posted in Course
Information for all the evaluation guidelines.
