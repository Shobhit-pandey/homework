AN ETHICAL DILEMMA
------------------

Introduction
------------
1) Propose ethical situation.
2) Explore ethics implications of it through Kantanism, and Act
   Utilitarianism.
3) Choose ethical theory to morally justify action.

In this essay I will be exploring the ethical implications of a personal
experience through the lenses of Kantanism and Act Utilitarianism. I
will then justify or unjustify the morallity using one of the ethical
theories


Moral Dilemma
-------------
Bursting through the computer lab doors, Abe's face was filled fear and
anxiety. The other student workers and I could tell something was wrong
, when Abe said: "I'm in huge trouble. I think I might get expelled."

The previous weekend, after getting his registration PIN Abe, out of
curiosity, wrote a simple program that would brute force guess
his registration PIN. Surprised it worked, he put the
program up freely available online, and mentioned it offhandedly
to his friend Ben. Not wanting to have to meet with his
advisor, Ben used Abe's program to guess his PIN. 

An Advisor noticed Ben had registered for classes without scheduling a
meeting, and interegated him. Not wanting to rat on his friend, Ben lied
about how he had gotten it. This left Abe in the position of having to
decide to stay quiet, and be found out, or fess up and admit he wrote
the program.

Was it ethical for Ben to use the program Abe had created? Would the
situation be different if Abe hadn't told his friend about the program?

These questions of ethics I will explore using the frameworks of
Kantinism and Act Utilitarianism. After exploring the questions I will
give a moral justification based upon one of the theories.

Kantinism judges choices based on the concept of a 'good will' and
provides two formulations of the 'Categorical Imperative' to constuct a
framwork for evaluation. According to the second formulation of the
Categorical Imperative, Ben's actions were unethical. To get his
registration PIN, Ben treated his advisor as a means to an end, rather
than a guide to the complex university registration requirement.

The first formulation of the Categorical Imperative would say that
again, Ben's actions were unethical. Ben abused the computer resources
of the university and sidestepped policies. If everyone sidestepped
university policies they did want to deal with, then university policies
would no longer have use, and there would be no way to enforce
restrictions on those who were disruptive or cheated. Since these
polices are required for a university to properly function it is
therefore wrong to sidestep university policies.

Lets look at the situation now from the perspective of Act Utilitarianism.
Act Utilitarianism states that actions are ethical if the sum of the
consequences are positive. Because Ben saved time by having to meet with
his advisor, and because the advisor saved time by having to meet with
one less student, the overall outcome of the situation is positive.
Therefore Act Utilitarianism would say Ben's actions were ethical.

Now Kantanism and Act Utilitarianism provide opposite answers to the
ethics of Ben's actions. I feel Ben's actions were unethical, and that
Kantanism is a better framework for evaluating his situation. Ben did
not have a 'good will' in mind, but a selfish will. He also broke
university policies for his own benefit, and treated his advisors as a
means to an end. Act Utilitarianism says his actions were ethical, but
this is only because it focuses on the individual and not society as a
whole.

In the end Abe and Ben both recieved disciplinary action, and Abe lost
his student job. Being unethical doesn't pay.
