AN ETHICAL DILEMMA
------------------

Introduction
------------
1) Propose ethical situation.
2) Explore ethics implications of it through Kantanism, and Act
   Utilitarianism.
3) Choose ethical theory to morally justify action.

In this essay I will be exploring the ethical implications of a personal
experience through the lenses of Kantanism and Act Utilitarianism. I
will then justify or unjustify the morallity using one of the ethical
theories


Moral Dilemma
-------------
Bursting through the computer lab doors, Abe's face was filled fear and
anxiety. The other student workers and I could tell something was wrong
, when Abe said: "I'm in huge trouble. I think I might get expelled."

The previous weekend, after getting his registration PIN Abe, out of
curiosity, wrote a simple program that would brute force guess
his registration PIN, and was surprised it worked.. He then put the
program online on Github, freely available, and mentioned it offhandedly
to his friend Ben. Not wanting to have to meet with his
advisor, Ben used Abe's program to guess his PIN. 

An Advisor noticed Ben had registered for classes without scheduling a
meeting, and interegated him. Not wanting to rat on his friend, Ben lied
about how he had gotten it, and then immediately told Abe his situation.

Was it ethical for Abe to create such a program, and freely distribute
it?

Kantanism
---------
Kantanism says:

This situation does not meet the second formulation of the Categorical
Imperative, since the adviser is being treated solely as a means to an
end (the Pin).

The first formulation shows that this is again unethical. If everyone
disobeyed university policies they did not agree with, then university
policies could no longer be inforced, and we would have anarchy. So it
is wrong to side-step university policies.

Act Utilitarianism
------------------
Act Utilitarianism says:

Using the brute force pin guesser was okay, as it increased the
happiness of all parties involved, because both parties were able to
save time.

The advisor had 1 less student to meet with, and the student could
register for classes
