AN ETHICAL DILEMMA
------------------

One day while working in the lab, a student co-worker came in with a
worried expression and started explaining a dillema he was having. To
protect his privacy I will refer to him as Abe. Abe was in a deep pile
of crap. He had created a program to brute force his registration pin
for school, and used it to register for the next term, without having to
see his adviser. He had then put the program up on github, where it was
freely available, and told some friends about it. One of his friends,
Ben, downloaded the program and used it to get his pin as well. Later,
in the term Ben met with his adviser, and the adviser noticed he was
never actually given his pin. When questioned about his, Ben said he had
used a program, but did not say where the program came from or who had
written it.

What do ethical theories say about these choices, and whether or not
they were ethical?
