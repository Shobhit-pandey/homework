AN ETHICAL DILEMMA
------------------

Introduction
------------
1) Propose ethical situation.
2) Explore ethics implications of it through Kantanism, and Act
   Utilitarianism.
3) Choose ethical theory to morally justify action.

In this essay I will be exploring the ethical implications of a personal
experience through the lenses of Kantanism and Act Utilitarianism. I
will then justify or unjustify the morallity using one of the ethical
theories


Moral Dilemma
-------------
Bursting through the computer lab doors, Abe's face was filled fear and
anxiety. The other student workers and I could tell something was wrong
and the first words Abe said were: "I think I'm in huge trouble."

The previous weekend, Abe had written a simple program that would guess
his registration PIN by brute force all the possible numbers, and he put
the program online freely available. He was using this program to get
around having to meet with his advisor this term. Advising in COE
requires you meet with an advisor every term. Apparently word had
spread about his program, because a university rep emailed him asking
him to take it offline. 


...told some friends about it. One of his friends,
Ben, downloaded the program and used it to get his pin as well. Later,
in the term Ben met with his adviser, and the adviser noticed he was
never actually given his pin. When questioned about his, Ben said he had
used a program, but did not say where the program came from or who had
written it.

What do ethical theories say about these choices, and whether or not
they were ethical?

Kantanism
---------
Kantanism says:

This situation does not meet the second formulation of the Categorical
Imperative, since the adviser is being treated solely as a means to an
end (the Pin).

The first formulation shows that this is again unethical. If everyone
disobeyed university policies they did not agree with, then university
policies could no longer be inforced, and we would have anarchy. So it
is wrong to side-step university policies.

Act Utilitarianism
------------------
Act Utilitarianism says:

Using the brute force pin guesser was okay, as it increased the
happiness of all parties involved, because both parties were able to
save time.

The advisor had 1 less student to meet with, and the student could
register for classes
