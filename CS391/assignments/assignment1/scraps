Here in lies the rub. I completely understand Abe's use of technology
to, subvert that which is a buerocratic annoyance, save his and other's
time. At Oregon State we are required to write up a two year plan. Since
we are the ones taking the classes, we are well aware if we are on track
or not with our program. We still have to have a meeting with an
adviser, never the same one twice, every term to get a pin. This is an
extremely annoying formality, as most advisors have not taken the
classes, nor have any experience with the professors or material to make
good judgements on the workload we will have, nor the classes/professors
we will enjoy.

What I'm really saying is the advisors are shit brains.

I would love to use that program to get my pin, when I am doing well in
classes, and only have the university require advising appointments when
a drastic change happens in my grades, or there is some general decline
in progress/results.(Grades slowling going down hill, or steep drop. 4.0
-> 2.0, or 4.0 -> 3.5 -> 3.0).
