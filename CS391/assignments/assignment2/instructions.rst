Essay for chapter 3.

Select a personal experience (preferred) or a current event relating to one of
the topics covered in the chapter "Networked Communications." Write an essay
following the formatting guidelines (refer to the criterion for details)
describing the experience or event, how it relates to the chapter, and what
moral and/or ethical issues there are regarding the experience or event. You
must also find and site suitable support evidence--this does NOT need to prove
or disprove your issue; it's meant to further your critical perspective on the
issue you have chosen.  Using at least one of the ethical theories to evaluate
the issue is the minimum requirement. You might want to use one
consequentialist and one non-consequentialist theory as continuing preparation
(and practice) for the midterm.

The following file formats are the ONLY ones acceptable: * Microsoft Word *
