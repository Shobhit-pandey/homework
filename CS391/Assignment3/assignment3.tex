11:45 PM. Corvallis, Oregon Gamestop. While hundreds of gamers are lined up
in the cold to get their hands on the midnight release of Diablo 3 for
PC, I stood in line as one of the few awiting a copy of Max Payne 3 for
Xbox 360. I have been waiting for this game since about four months ago
when I saw an anouncement in GameInformer magazine. 





The internet. I have used the interne all my life. For two days I went
without the internet. It wasn't hard. I'm sure for others it might have
been, but I am used to it. Not that I generally don't use the internet,
but because I spend a lot of time off tline, doing other things. I read,
play guitar, danc (boy do I DANCE!), but most of all I don't use the
internet all that much because of what it represents. Nope. Quit trying
to be phylisophical and just write. The Internet. Blhe. Ummmmmm. It
wasn't hard to not use the internet because most of the time I spend
using the internet is a wast of time. Recently I deleted my facebook
account, and I found that I caught myself typing \url{http://www.facebook.com}, more
often than not, when I don't even have one. At random times. If I'm
bord. Faceboook. Someone asks/tells me to loo at a picture, Facebook.
Email notification that I have a new message. Facebook. Facebook,
facebook, facebook. Our culter is addicted to it. It's a disease. Well,
not as much of a disease as Angry Birds marketing is, but you get the
point. II was at a dance last weekend and a friend asked me to if I was
going to a friend's party that night. I said "What party"? They looked
at me funny. The one on facebook, they said. Didn't you get the invite?
I had to laugh. No, I said. I don't have a facebook anymore. Their
immediate reaction: "Why?". Why?...Why not? What is so pressing about
afcebook that American's need one? 

The only reason my friends have a facebook is because my friends have a
facebook. This sounds tautologicall, because it is. MSocial media has
always been seen as this great connector, or enabler of community, but
most of the time it is wasted  with status updates of breakups, baby
facts, or cat pictures. None of the discussion revolves around anything
important, or if it does it is mainly conversation in AALL
CAPPSSSSS!!!1!!!.

That's th eproblem with social media/networking. Those tow terms.
Social. Networking. This is the internet, why is it supposed to be
social? Do you have to give labels to these aplications to say that they
are "Social" because theiy inherientyly aren't? I don't think so. Blogs
have been around since the internet started and they are 'Social
Networking" For some reason people got fed the crap that in order to be
'connected' online you had tobe on a social networking site. This is
dumb. There are plenty of sites that do what facebook does, but
individually. Your argument: Yeah, but facebook does it all in one
place. So? There is this great thing called RSS, and APIs, and Feeds,
and Streams and whatever else you want to call them. You could make
Facebook, but make it seperated by having a site which your twitter
stream in the center, conected to users linkedIn profiles, and events
would be handled on calegator, or google events. 'notes' which no one
uses except to post horrible poetry, would be used to by wordpress, or
blogger, or livejournal.  All of your information would be in one place,
without ADS.













I have grown up in the internet age. It was in  middle school when my
family got our first computer that had a modem as well. It wasn't until
about freshman year of High School that we upgraded our service to DSL,
and then later Cable. Because of the limited speed of our internet, and 

Having grown up in the internet age and experiencing the transition from
56k modems to DSL, then Cable, and now Fiber internet,  


8:30am - Woke up to have a long gaming weekend. Went to look up Max
Payne 3 achievement guide online, but couldn't.
