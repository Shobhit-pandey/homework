This assignment requires some planning, so please start early.

For this assignment, I want you to:

1. Document over a continuous 48 hour period how you use the Internet. What
devices do you use to access the Internet, what resources, for what purpose,
for how long a period of time. This includes things like emailing, browsing the
web, watching videos of youtube, using facebook, using twitter, gaming, etc. I
don't need to or want to know what sites you visit, who you email etc, but try
and be as meticulous as you can. If you can, try and document how much
bandwidth you or your household consume. Reflect on how much of that use is
essential to either your work or your family life vs. discretionary.

2. Live the same continuous 48 hour period completely net free. No accessing
email, web, online gaming etc., whether at home or work, on a computer or a
cell phone, no netflix streaming etc., and you cannot instruct someone else to
access the internet for you. If you have a job, you may have to pick a weekend.
Document what difficulties if any you experience, how this changed your
every-day activities, and how being disconnected makes you feel. Reflect on
your experience and feelings.

5-6 pages.
