<h1>Project 2: UNIX file I/O and getting reacquainted with C</h1>

<h2>Due: Monday, 28 October 2013, 23:59:59</h2>

<p>In this assignment, you will be working with UNIX file I/O system calls.</p>

<p>Write a C program (and yes, I mean C!) on <tt>os-class</tt> called <tt>myar.c</tt>. This program will
  illustrate the use of file I/O on UNIX by maintaining a UNIX archive library, in the
  standard archive format.</p>


<p>Once compiled your program should run in a manner similar to the standard UNIX command
  <tt>ar</tt>. You may wish to look at the man page for <tt>ar</tt> for insight, however,
  for this assignment, the following is the syntax your program must support:</p>

<p><tt>myar key afile name ...</tt></p>

<p>where <tt>afile</tt> is the name of the archive file to be used, and key is one of the
  following options (all are silent unless otherwise specified):</p>


<p>
</p><table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr><td align="LEFT"><tt>-v</tt></td>
    <td align="LEFT">iff specified with other options, print a verbose version of the output</td>
    <td align="LEFT">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-q</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      quickly append named files to archive
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      &nbsp;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-x</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      extract named files
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      &nbsp;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-t</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      print a concise table of contents of the archive
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      &nbsp;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT"><tt>-d</tt></td>
    <td align="LEFT">delete named files from archive</td>
    <td align="LEFT">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-A</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      quickly append all ``regular'' files in the current directory
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      (except the archive itself)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-w</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      Extra credit: for a given timeout, add all modified files to the archive.
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      (except the archive itself)
    </td>
  </tr>

<p>You must use <tt>getopt</tt> to parse the command line options (and <bf>only</bf> <tt>getopt</tt> -- do not use <tt>getopt_long</tt>).</p>

<p>The archive file maintained must use exactly the standard format defined in
  <tt>/usr/inc1ude/ar.h</tt>, and in fact may be tested with archives created with the
  <tt>ar</tt> command. The options listed above are compatible with the options having
  the same name in the <tt>ar</tt> command. <tt>-A</tt> is a new option not
  in the usual <tt>ar</tt> command.</p>

<p>Notes:</p> 

<ol>
  <li>
    For the <tt>-q</tt> command <tt>myar</tt> should create an archive file if it doesn't
    exist, using permissions ``666''. For the other commands <tt>myar</tt> reports an
    error if the archive does not exist, or is in the wrong format.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will have to use the system calls <tt>stat</tt> and <tt>utime</tt> to properly
    deal with extracting and restoring the proper timestamps. Since the archive format
    only allows one timestamp, store the <tt>mtime</tt> and use it to restore both
    the <tt>atime</tt> and
    <tt>mtime</tt>. Permissions should also be restored to the original value, subject to
    <tt>umask</tt> limitation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <tt>-q</tt> and <tt>-A</tt> commands do not check to see if a file by the chosen name
    already exists. It simply appends the files to the end of the archive.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <tt>-x</tt> and <tt>-d</tt> commands operate on the first file matched in the archive,
    without checking for further matches.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the case of the <tt>-d</tt> option, you will have to build a new archive file to recover
    the space. Do this by unlinking the original file after it is opened, and creating a new archive
    with the original name.
  </li>
  <li>
    You are required to handle multiple file names as arguments.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since file I/O is expensive, do not make more than one pass through the archive file, an
    issue especially relevant to the multiple delete case.
  </li>
  <li>
  Compilation will be done with <tt>icc</tt> and use (at minimum) the following flags: '<tt>-std=c99 -Wall</tt>'.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the <tt>-w</tt> flag, the command will take as long as specified by the timeout
    argument. You should print out a status message upon adding a new file only if <tt>-v</tt> is specified. This may
    result in many different copies of the same file in the archive.
  </li>
  <li>
    For extra credit, any time a file is added that already exists, 
remove the old copy from the archive, but ONLY if it is not the same. If
 identical, do not add the new file. Size is NOT a valid indication of 
isomorphism. You will need to use a more advanced technique.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Your write-up should include (at minimum) the following:

</p><ol>
  <li> a design for your system, as well as places your implementation deviated from this
    design</li>
  <li>a work log, detailing what you did when -- this can fairly easily be created if you
    are using some form of revision control</li>
  <li>any challenges you overcame in completing this assignment</li>
  <li>answers to the following questions:</li>
  <ol>
    <li> What do you think the main point of this assignment is?</li>
    <li> How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance. This section should be very thorough.</li>
    <li> What did you learn?</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Things to turn in:</p>
<ol>
<li> C source code </li>
<li> write-up, as a tex document </li>
<li> any support files necessary to compile your tex document or source </li>
<li> a makefile to build both source code and your tex file </li>
</ol>

<p>You are not allowed to use Lyx to create the document. You must create the document "by
hand", instead.</p>
