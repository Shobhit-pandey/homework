Project 2 Outline
-----------------
-q  (quickly append named files to archive)
    open archive
    for each file in filelist
        open the file
        get metadata from the file
        create an ar_hdr from metadata
        write ar_hdr to archive
        write file to archive
        close the file
    close the archive

-x  extract named files  
    open archive
    for header in headerlist
        for filename in filelist
            if filename in header
                open file (filename)
                write file
                change file time w/utime
                close file
    close archive
    
-t  print a concise table of contents of the archive     
    open archive
    for header in headerlist
        print filename
    close archive
        
-v  print a verbose table of contents of the archive     
    open archive
    for header in headerlist
        print verbose output
    close archive

del_file struct {
    offset
    filesize
}
-d  delete named files from archive  
    open archive
        unlink archive
        create new archive
            set write buffer past archive header
        for header in headers
            for filename in filelist
                if filename in header
                    skip header ( move write pointer forward )
                    skip file
                else
                    write header and file to archive
        close new archive
    close archive
        
 
-A  quickly append all ``regular'' files in the current directory   (except the archive itself)
    -q with IS_REG check when building filelist
