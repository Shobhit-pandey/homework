1. sudo yum install epel-release \
   && sudo yum install bash-completion curl \
   jwhois lsof man man-pages man-pages-overrides \
   nc net-tools

2. rpm -qf /bin/bash

3. sork -k2 pkgs | cut -d' ' -f2 | uniq -c

4. du reports /tmp as 1.1G because of the `-L` option passed to du. `-L`
dereferences symbolic links, which makes du count `/home/centos/zeros`
as part of the size of /tmp.

5. There is always reserved space for the root user so that even if
other users fill out the system, root still has space to maneuver files.
A large file may been deleted, but the process that opened the file is
still running. du would not show the file, but df would as df looks at
inodes.

6. These special characters can be found in the bash man page under
PARAMETERS -> Special Parameters.

$* - positional arguments expanded to a single word separated by the
     first character of IFS.
$@ - positional arguments expanded to separate words"$1" "$2"
$? - exit code of last command
$! - process id of most recently backgrounded process
$$ - process id of the current shell, even if in a subshell

7. In the mid-2000 there was a shift towards more agile and responsive
operations. This lead to an explosion of tools and greater collaboration
between developers and operations.

8. Linus Torvalds created and maintains the mainline Linux Kernel. Greg
Kroah-Hartman maintains the stable release.

The first Linux distribution was 'SLS Linux'

9. 

- Ext 4: 2008, current standard and works for large files - Good for new
         drives.
- Ext 3: 2001, Added journaling to ext2 - 
- Ext 2: 1993, 'Second extended filesystem' - Good for USB drives and /boot
         because it doesn't have the overhead of journaling.

10. /usr/local

11. 

- chkconfig ntpd on
- service ntpd start

12. dd if=/dev/zeros of=disk-image bs=1M count=20

13. mkfs.ext4 disk-image

mke2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
disk-image is not a block special device.

This filesystem will be automatically checked every 31 mounts or
100 days, whichever comes first. Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.

losetup /dev/loop0 disk-image

mkdir /mnt/disk-image
mount -o loop /dev/loop0 /mnt/disk-image/

user@localhost:~$ df -h /mnt/disk-image/

15.

user@localhost:~$ fsck.ext4 /dev/loop0 
e2fsck 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)
/dev/loop0: clean, 11/5136 files, 1849/20480 blocks

Running fsck on a mounted filesystem will corrupt the filesystem.

16. The maximum mount count is set to 31, and the check interval to
15552000 (6 months).

I found this by running:

    tune2fs -l /dev/loop0

To change the interval to 10 days, I could run:

    tune2fs -i 10d /dev/loop0

17. resize2fs /dev/loop0 40M
