1.1)

Load - High load is 100% usage on all CPUs. A server with a load of
1 does not necessarily have 100% CPU usage. The critical threshold
should be set to # of CPUs, and warning to 2/3 load. It might be
best to have these higher, as it's fine for processing loads to
occasionally spike for a short period of time.

1.2)

Disk - Disks should never be maxed out, as the server will not be able
to create new files (especially logs, if done locally).  Thresholds
should be set conservatively (50% warning, 75% critical) so that
moving/managing data can be easily facilitated. These percentages may be
too small for servers with large amounts of data (>5TB) as 10% would be
5G which is generally enough wiggle-room.

1.3)

Network - A server can become unreachable if it runs out of network
connections to allocate. There are even attacks (slowloris) designed to
slowly eat up a server's network connections. As the default cap for
maximum connections is 65,535, a critical threshold would be half of
this (32,768) with a warning at 1/4 (16,384). This is dependent upon the
server type though, as some (such as vpn, firewalls, load balancers) may
manage many connections and may benefit from a higher threshold.

2.1) 

Plugins: Scripts that gather information about servers. Can be written
in any language that accepts command line arguments.

2.2)

NRPE/NSCA: Daemons that run active and passive plugins respectively.

2.3)

Core Server process: The master nagios daemon that collects data from
NRPE/NSCA checks.

2.4)

CGI Web Interface: Web interface that talks to the core server daemon
over a socket. Useful for viewing and looking at the history of checks.

3.1)

Passive checks run on the remote server, collect data, and send it back
to Nagios, whereas active checks are initiated by Nagios, connect to the
server, and run the command. (Push vs. Pull)

3.2)

Active checks require running of the NRPE daemon, whereas passive checks
only require the plugin and the send_nsca application.

3.3)

Passive checks can scale to thousands of hosts, while active checks may
cause disruptions and increase load. (Nagios as a DoS)

5) 

A recursive DNS server will perform recursive lookups for clients, by
first asking the TLD server, and continuing on until it gets an A
record.

An authoritative DNS server responds to requests as the authority of a
domain. It contains a SOA record for the domain.

An recursive server (generally your ISP's) is used when asking for the
address of osuosl.org, and an (osuosl's) authoritative server responds
with the address for osuosl.org. You would use the authoritative server
if you wanted to know what records (or subdomains) it manages. 

6)

A - Address Record. Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
AAAA - Quad A. Maps a domain to an IPv6 Address.
CNAME - Canonical Name. Mapping of domain name to another domain name.
MX - Mail. Specifies where mail is to be sent. Includes an extra field
           for priority.
NS - Name Server. Specify the dns servers of a domain.
NXDOMAIN - Non-Existent Domain. A record the represents the absence of a
           host.
7)

Because name servers are designated by NS records, and name servers are
themselves subdomains of the domains they manage, there is the
possibility of getting into circular dependencies. To solve this,  glue
records are given in the additional information of a dns query, so that
additional lookup aren't required.

8)

Sensitivity: The likelihood an event has occurred given the criteria for
the event is met. If your house burglar alarm goes off, without there
being a burglar, it has a high sensitivity. 
Specificity: The likelihood an event has not occurred given the criteria
is met. If a burglar breaks in and the alarm doesn't go off, the alarm
has a low specificity.

Good alarms should have low sensitivity, and high specificity. They
don't go off when they shouldn't, and they do go off when they should.

9)

Airport scanners have low specificity and high sensitivity. They alert
even on small metallic objects, and rarely alert on
non-metallic items.

10)

Time series data is a set of data measured over time. Some good examples
are the price of gas over the last year, or your cost of groceries over
the last 10 trips to the store. It consists of the data being measured
(gas, groceries, etc) and a time period (years, days, events, etc).

It is important for finding patterns and trends in data. In monitoring
it is helpful to answering questions such as:

* Is this a recurring event?
* How often does this event happen?
* Does this event happen at a specific time of day, week, month?
* Is there a specific point when this event started happening?

11)

DHCP uses the broadcast scheme because clients on a network don't know 
who the DHCP server is ahead of time. If a client knew what the server
address was ahead of time, it could directly query it using unicast.
DHCP servers hand out addresses and must use broadcast because they
don't know who asked for the address to begin with. If they client
already had address, it wouldn't need to ask for one.

12)

Automatic - The DHCP server hands out an address to any client that
            asks, and will never ask for it back.

Static - DHCP controls the addresses, but they are only given out to
         explicit hosts identified by their MAC addresses.

Dynamic - Normal DHCP operation. Addresses are 'leased' out to clients
          and clients are expected to renew their address after a set
          timeout.
