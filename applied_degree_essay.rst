Communication takes up a large portion of the open source development 
process. Though communication is key to other disciplines as well, open
source development is unique in that most of the communication is
conducted online across cultural boundries. This is why I feel an
Applied Computer Science degree in Open Source Development should be
focused on aquiring a depth of communication skills.
