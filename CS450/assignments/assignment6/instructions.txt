Assignment #6 - Simple Shadow Mapping
Due December 5, 2014 by 11:59 pm

For the sixth and final assignment for this class, I would like to
implement a simple shadow map, and a moving light source. I am
choosing this topic for 3 reasons: 
   
    1. The scope is small. 
    2. It continues upon the logical progression presented by this class. 
    3. It involves the depth buffer Â­ a buffer we have had little
       interaction with. 
    
Simple shadow maps, also known as projective shadowing, are on the same
level of realism as the Phong Illumination model. They use a simple
model of light to construct simple shadows, and can be computed in this
way: 

    1. Transform from world coordinates to light coordinates. In other
       words, render the scene as if the view (eye) was directly at the
       light source. 
    2. Save the depth buffer 
    3. Continue transformations to screen coordinates. 
    4. In the fragment shader, use the depth buffer to check if a fragment
       is within shadow. 
    5. If the fragment is not in shadow,  illuminate it. 

They may be more steps involved in this process, or unneeded steps, as
these steps were 
extrapolated from the Wikipedia explanation. 
  
Rubric 
   
    * Shadows present. 
    * Ground Plane present. 
    * Light rotates around object. 
    * Shadows rotate with light. 
    * Shadows match rotation of object.
