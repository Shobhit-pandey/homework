Assignment #1 - 2D Graphics
===========================
Due Sunday, 10/13 by Midnight

There are two goals for this assignment.

    Get a working development environment set up for all future assignments
    Write your first 2D OpenGL program 

The assignment is fairly open-ended in that YOU get to decide what to draw.
There are, however, a few requirements that you must meet.

    (30 pts) Scene must contain at least 3 geometric models with a combined
             total of AT LEAST 25 vertices. You may use a single VBO or
             multiple VBO's. At least one geometric model should contain
             per vertex colors (see below) These vertices can be
             hardcoded or generated algorithmically (e.g. like the
             Sierpinski Gasket in the textbook) .
    (15 pts) Demonstrate use of at least 3 OpenGL primitives (POINTS,
             LINES, TRIANGLES)
    (20 pts) Demonstrate use of an array of colors to color primitives
    (15 pts) Use of only modern opengl functionality (no deprectaed
             function calls)
    (20 pts) Use clean programming style and documentation

Be creative, have fun, and be sure to meet the requirements. You can
work in OpenGL or WebGL...your choice.

Turn In
-------

Using TEACH, please turn in a single zip file that includes your source
code (.h, .cpp). PLEASE NO DEBUG FOLDERS or project files!!! Also,
please turn in a readme.txt file with instructions on how to use your
application(if necessary). You'll be demoing your code to the TAs for
your final grade.
