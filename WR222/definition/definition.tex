\section*{Introduction}
It's 6am. You wake up and hear moaning coming from the otherside of your
bedroom door. Afraid of what it could be, you pick up the trusty shotgun
leaning against your bed as you pull away the covers. Climbing out of bed
you open the door and find your mother, now turned into a Zombie, shuffling
towards you, trying to eat your brains. Do you pull the trigger?
Contrary to popular culture, taking the life of a Zombie is no simple matter.
Mention Zombies to anyone and generally their mind will juxtapose images of
chainsaws, shotguns, and katanas. Our culture has deeply engrained within us
the will to kill any and all Zombies. This is morally and ethically wrong
because Zombies are Humans too.

\subsection*{Thesis}
Humans who have been infected with a virus and turned into Zombies should
still be considered human because viruses can be cured. Therefore, with the
right medicine, they could be returned to their original human state.




\subsection*{Publication}
I will be writing this for \emph{The Onion}. As it is to be taken humorously.

\section*{Definitions}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Zombie]{There are many varying definitions of `Zombies' out there. The Zombies I am
        talking about are defined by Max Brookes' ``The Zombie Survival Guide.''}
        \item[Human]{Humans are well...human.}
    \end{description}


% Find dictionary definition

\paragraph{Human Rights}
Human Rights are defined by The Universal Human Rights (United Nations).

%\section*{Body}
%\paragraph{One}
%\paragraph{Two}
%\paragraph{Three}

\section*{Naysayer}
``The Zombie Survival Guide'' as a whole is seen as a naysayer because it
prmotes violence against Zombies. The second chapter is titled `Weapons and
Combat Techniques.'


\section*{Conclusion}
\paragraph{Why does this matter?}
When and if a zombie outbreak does occur, Zombies should be treated with the
same respect as other humans, and not outright massacured. Because Zombies are
Humans, they should be treated with the same respect as all humans are treated
according to \emph{The Universal Declaration of Human Rights}, Article 3:
``Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.''



\section*{Notes}
I'm defining humans, and how zombies fit in the category of humans.
I am not defining Zombies with the exception of what zombies I am refering to.
