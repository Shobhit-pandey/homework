\subsection*{Thesis}
Humans who have been infected with a virus and turned into Zombies, should
stll be granted human rights because viruses can be cured; therefore they can
return to their normal human state.
\subsection*{Publication}
I will be writing this for \emph{The Onion}. As it is to be taken humorously.

\section*{Naysayer}
``The Zombie Survival Guide'' as a whole is seen as a naysayer because it
prmotes violence against Zombies. The second chapter is titled `Weapons and
Combat Techniques.'
\section*{Conclusion}
\paragraph{Why does this matter?}
When and if a zombie outbreak does occur, Zombies should be treated with the
same respect as other humans, and not outright massacured.
