% BEGIN PAPER
It's 6am. You wake up and hear moaning coming from the otherside of your
bedroom door. Afraid of what it could be, you pick up the trusty shotgun
leaning against your bed as you pull away the covers. Climbing out of bed
you bravely open the door. Standing before you is your mother, now a zombie.
Shuffling towards you and trying to eat your brains. Your natural intstincts
kick in and you raise up your shotgun as you backaway.
Would you pull the trigger?

Contrary to pop culture, taking the life of a zombie is no simple matter.
Mention zombies to anyone and their mind will juxtapose images of
chainsaws, shotguns, and katanas. Our culture has deeply engrained within us
the will to kill all zombies. This is morally and ethically wrong
because zombies are humans too. zombie who came to be through a viral
transformation of a human, are still humans.\label{thesis}  
Humans who have been infected with a virus and turned into zombies should
still be considered human, because viruses can be cured. Therefore, with the
right medical treatment, they could be returned to their original human state.

Several people have commented that zombies can't be human since they have died
and then been brought back to life. This comment is based on the assumption
that I am referring to Romero's zombies as seen in \underline{Night of the
Living Dead} but this is a false assumption because the zombies I am referring
to are known as the modern infected zombie. They are defined by Max Brooks' 
``The Zombie Survival Guide''.

\paragraph{Naysayer}
\emph{The Zombie Survival Guide} contains large sections devoted to
exterminating zombies and very little information on peaceful detention.
It promotes violence against zombies. In the second chapter titled `Weapons and
Combat Techniques.', Brooks provides his readers with a large amount of
information regarding how to properly kill zombies; there are several
comparisons given between weapon choices like ``The advantage of slicing over
bludgeoning is that it can make killing a zombie unnecesssuy. In some cases,
simply chopping off a limb or severing the spine is enough to disable an
undead assailant.'' (Brooks).

\paragraph{Conclusion}
\subparagraph{Why does this matter?}
When and if a zombie outbreak does occur, zombies should not be outright
massacured, but be treated with the same respect as humans. Zombies should be
treated with the same respect all humans are given.
According to \emph{The Universal Declaration of Human Rights}, Article 3:
``Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.''

\paragraph{Notes}
I'm defining humans, and how zombies fit in the category of humans.
I am not defining zombies with the exception of what zombies I am refering to.

\subparagraph{Human Rights}
Human Rights are defined by The Universal Human Rights (United Nations).

\subparagraph{Publication}
I will be writing this for \emph{The New York Times} because it is a respected
publication and has a large audience both within and outside the U.S., and
would be read by those in densly populated areas where a zombie outbreak is
most likely to occur first.
