\section*{Introduction}
Mention Zombies to anyone and generally their mind will juxtapose images of
chainsaws, shotguns, and katanas. Our culture has deeply engrained within us
the will to kill any and all Zombies. This is morally and ethically wrong
because Zombies are Humans too.

\subsection*{Thesis}
Humans who have been infected with a virus and turned into Zombies should
still be considered human because viruses can be cured. Therefore, with the
right medicine, they could be returned to their original human state.

\subsection*{Publication}
I will be writing this for \emph{The Onion}. As it is to be taken humorously.

\section*{Definitions}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Zombie]{There are many varying definitions of `Zombies' out there. The Zombies I am
        talking about are defined by Max Brookes' ``The Zombie Survival Guide.''}
        \item[Human]{Humans are well...human.}
    \end{description}

%\paragraph{Three}

\section*{Naysayer}
``The Zombie Survival Guide'' as a whole is seen as a naysayer because it
prmotes violence against Zombies. The second chapter is titled `Weapons and
Combat Techniques.'


\section*{Conclusion}
\paragraph{Why does this matter?}
When and if a zombie outbreak does occur, Zombies should be treated with the
same respect as other humans, and not outright massacured. 



\section*{Notes}
I'm defining humans, and how zombies fit in the category of humans.
I am not defining Zombies with the exception of what zombies I am refering to.
