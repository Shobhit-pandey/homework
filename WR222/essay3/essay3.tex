"Oregon State University president saw a sign with "www.orst.edu," and didn't
want to have the "worst" edu domain. (Read it again.) That led OSU's president
to get in touch with the folks running the Web site. Having drawn the attention
of the university leadership to the Web presence, OSU paid more attention to
hosting and eventually got into the business of hosting for open source
projects."

"Our CIO (Curt Pederson) chose to fund a fiber build-out to I-5 and the Open Source Lab. The strategic funds are seed money to get the OSL off the ground and we're well on our way to cost recovery." -- Scott Kveton
"OSU's information services group had a bit of a financial disaster 8 years ago; our former CIO went a little crazy writing checks, etc. After the dust settled, we were left with a huge debt, and increasing user base and the need to provide a lot more with a lot less. We had no choice but to turn to open source." -- Scott Kveton
