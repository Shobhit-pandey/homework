Yogas
-----
When I hear the word "Yoga," I think of the numerous men and women I see
daily with toned muscles and yoga mats under their arm, walking by me on
their way to class. Yet the word "Yoga" means more then getting a good
stretch in. In Hinduism, Yoga is a collection of disciplines aimed at
achieving spiritual enlightenment. They are called Jnana, Bhakti,
Karma, and Raja, and each focuses on a different aspect.


Jnana Yoga
``````````
Jnana's focus is on knowledge...


Bhakti Yoga
```````````
Bhakti is all about emotion: specifically love.


Karma Yoga
``````````
Karma literally means "work".


Raja Yoga
`````````
Raja is about experimentation. This is not the double entendre meaning
of experimentation. It much closer resembles scientific experimentation.
