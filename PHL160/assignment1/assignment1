Yogas
=====

In Houston Smith's "The World's Religions," Smith explains that there
are four yogas in the Hindu religion. These are Jnana, Bhakti, Karma,
and Raja. I will give a summary of his explanation of each, and then
determine which yoga is, as he says: "... the suit that is strongest."

4 Yogas
-------

Jnana - Knowledge
  - Not about knowing facts.
  - Three steps to seeing the inner/deeper self - below the surface.
  - 1 - Learning
        "introduced to the prospect that [their] essential being is Being
        itself"
    2 - Thinking
        Reflecting on what we are vs. the physical makeup of us
    3 - Identifying
        Driving into our mind the fact that who we are is separate from
        what we are. Our essense is not our physical body. Shifts our
        identity from our body and mind to our soul.

Bhakti - Love/Emotion
  - "Love God"
  - Most popular of four
  - God is not self, but otherness. Outside of us.
  - jnana sees God without personality, infinite. bhakti see God with
    attributes.
  - 2 points
    - God is otherness, outside us. Not underlying Self.
    - Adore with all being, instead of identify with, God
  - Love God
    - Dearly
    - Only
    - For Love sake alone
  - 3 Features
    - Japam - "pray without ceasing"
    - Ringing the Changes - Different kinds of love. Express them all,
      especially loveing God as own child (love for _your_ child).
    - Chosen ideal
      Many representations. Choose _ishta_, adopted form. Form lifelong
      attachment encouraged, with use of others allowed. Ishta special
      place in heart.


Karma - Work
  - Practices in Bhakti or Jnana
    - Bhakti - Devotion
      - Work for God, not self. As woman works for husband, slave for
        master.

    - Jnana - Detachment
      - Work normally approached for pay or acclaim.
      - Approach work as duty. Starve ego.


Raja - Psychophysical Experimentation
  - Royal path
  - Scientific method for religious feelings
  - Experiments on mind, not body. Experiment on excersise, measure
    outcome.
  - 4 Layer
    1. Physical
    2. Conciousness
    3. Subconciousness
    4. (Eastern) Infinity.
  - Discover something forgotten by humanity, extremely important and
    helpful
  - 8 steps to Experiment
      1. Abstain: injury, lying, stealing, sensuality, greed
      2. Observe: clenliness, contentment, self-control, studiousness,
         contemplation of divine.
      (1,2) - Five finger excercises
      3. Remove distraction of body. Ignore itching and meditate.
      4. Control breathing.
      5. Turn senses inward toward infinite. 'In the zone'
      6. Quiet mind
      7. I am the tree, I am the jackel
      8. samadhi - complete absorption in God.

4 not exclusive. Some of each good.

Writing
-------

Jnana Yoga is about knowledge. This knowledge is not facts or trivia, but an
understanding of our inner being. Jnana Yoga is about being able to see and
perceive Being itself. There are three steps to Jnana. The first is
learning. Gaining the knowledge that there is an infinite within us.
The second step is thinking. Performing thought exercises to help reflect on the
knowledge of the infinite within. The last step is identifying. Jnana
Yoga helps us see the difference between who we are and what we are.
Smith uses an example of actors and masks with our physical selves being
the masks.


Bhakti Yoga is about love. Closely resembling the Christian theme of
"Love God with your whole being and your neighbor as yourself." It is
the most popular of the four Yogas. As Jnana Yoga sees God contained within
ourselves and around us, Bhakti focuses on God's otherness and adoration.
God is outside of us and has personality traits. God should be loved,
not ourselves as this can be misleading. The love for God should be
dear, only for God, and for the sake of love alone. Bhakti has three
features: japam, ringing the changes, and choosing an ideal. Japam is
having God be part of everything you do. God's name is always on your
mind and lips. "Pray without ceasing." Ringing the changes means that
your love is more than romance, as it is only one kind of love. The love
for God should also be as that towards your child, or brother, or
best friend. Choosing an ideal is finding an 'ishta' (adopted form) of
God. This 'ishta' is encouraged to be cherished throughout life.


Karma Yoga can be viewed as bhakti or jnana. Following Karma with bhakti
means working for God and not yourself, like a slave for his master, or
a woman for her husband. With Jnana it mean performing your work without
attachment to its rewards. This will starve the ego.


Raja or 'Royal' Yoga is about psychophysical experimentation. It is the
scientific method of Yoga, but experiments are performed on the mind not
the body. Works to find memories forgotten by humans, and gain a deeper
understanding of God. There are eight steps to the experiment. First is
abstinence from injury, lying, stealing, sensuality, and greed. Second
is observation of cleanliness, contentment, self-control, studiousness,
and the contemplation of the divine. These are referred to as the five
finger exercises. Third is the removal of distractions of the body and
finding a form for meditation. Fourth is control of breathing. Fifth is
turning the senses inward towards the infinite self. Sixth is quieting
the mind which is not an easy task. Seventh involves becoming self. Like
Siddartha's 'I am the Jackel'. And finally eighth is complete absorption
into God.


The Yoga I feel most in tune with is Bhakti. Though knowledge oriented,
I don't think deeply about my underlying self or infinite within. Though
dedicated to my job for somewhat higher means, it is still for the
reward of money and praise. I have never tried to meditate though I have
tried quieting my mind and it is not easy. Bhakti is most similar to
Christianity, which is my history. A lot of what I focus on is loving God
and loving others. My chosen ideal or Ishta would be Jesus.
