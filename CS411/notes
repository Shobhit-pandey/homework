======================
Kernel Data Structures
======================

- Linked Lists
    Four Kinds:
    - Singly or Doubly linked
    - Linear or Circularly

    Traditional:
    struct node {
        int x;
        int y;
        struct node *next:
        sturct node *prev;
    }

    Kernel:
    struct node_foo {
        int x;
        int y;
        struct list_head *item;
    }
    
    This works because structs are packed datastructures. So the address
      of a struct is the address of the first element.

- Binary Trees
    - Binary Search Tree (BST)
    - Red-Black Tree (RBtree)
      <rbtree.c>

- Queues
  kfifos

- Maps
  - Associative Array
  - Maps keys to values
  - _not_ a hash table
  Mapping a UID to a pointer (almost always a function pointer)
  They're called 'idr's (No one knows why!)

- Trie
    re-Trie-val Tree: Used by routers for LPM (logest prefix match)
    Slow to add, super fast to retrieve.
    n-ary trees (ex. words, 26 children, one for each letter)

- Bitmap


Filesystems
===========

Programs
(VFS)
Filesystems
Storage

open -> vfs_open -> specific filesystem open

Ideally we want concurrent access to data, therefore we can't share in
memory because it's protected. (Pages are protected)

* NTFS
* HFS+
* EXT
* xfs
* jfs
* ufs
* fat
* reiserfs

* zfs
* btrfs

A file is a logical unit of information.
An abstraction of on disk blocks

Files can be viewed as
* A hierarchy
* A collection of bytes
* ....

Files are just a sequence (lseek) of bytes
Files have attributes (stat)
