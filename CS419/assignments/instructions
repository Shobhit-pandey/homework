Assignment 1: Pick a Project

    Spend time investigating different FOSS projects and deciding which project
    you want to contribute to

    Rules:
      * No homegrown projects
      * No project you have contributed to in the past
      * Project must have 3+ active contributors

    In your writeup provide the following information:
      * Project name & URL
      * Project membership (aprox # & leadership structure)
      * Description of infrastructure/architecture + links
      * What the project is about & brief history
      * Rational for selection & what you want to contribute

Assignment 2 & 3: Make a contribution

    Make a contribution equivalent to at least 10 hours of work:
      * Code, bug report, documentation, QA, community management, helpdesk
        etc.
      * Document contribution and your work
      * Document the effort that went into making your contribution (see logs)
      * Reflect on the importance & impact on your contribution
      * Reflect on the experience (what worked, what did not, what did you
        learn, etc.)

    Reflect on learning process:
      * What worked?
      * What did not work?
      * What you have learned?
      * What is the top advice you wish someone had given you at the start of
        this course?
      * What you still need to figure out?
      * Recommendations for future students taking this or a similar course?
      * How will you continue your involvement with FOSS in the future, if at
        all?
