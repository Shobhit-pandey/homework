\section*{Problem 1}

Throughout the lecture, we assumed that no two edges in the input graph
have equal weights, which implies that the minimum spanning tree is
unique. In fact, a weaker condition on the edge weights implies MST
uniqueness.

\subsection*{(a)}
Describe an edge-weighted graph that has a unique minimum spanning tree,
even though two edges have equal weights.

\subsection*{(b)}
Prove that an edge-weighted graph $G$ has a unique minimum spanning tree
if the following condition holds:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For any partition of the vertices of $G$ into two subsets, the
          minimum-weight edge with one endpoint in each subset is unique.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{(c)}
Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether or not a graph
has a unique minimum spanning tree.
