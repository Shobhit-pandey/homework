1a. k = 10110101, m = 11101011
    k ^ m = 10100001

    1) Verify AND operation for Enc and Dec

1b.

    1) Verify Enc and Dec output

2.

Perfect secrecy states that the distribution is uniform at random. It
is possible a word can be decrypted to multiple valid English strings.
Even if Eve did try every k in K, she would not know if she had found
the correct one or not.

3. 

In order for perfect secrecy to hold, all terms (c, k, m) must
distribute uniformly at random. Because the OTP key is reused, there is
now a larger distribution of c, which allows Eve to narrow down k and
correctly guess m.

5.

The secret is first divided into 3 parts in a 3-out-of-3 scheme. Each
of these parts is then further divided into a 2-out-of-3 scheme.

In order for the full secret to be revealed, all 3 parts of the scheme
have to be used, and in order for all 3 parts of the scheme to be
revealed, at least 2 out of the 3 members of each subcommittee must be
present.
