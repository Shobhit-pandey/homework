<h1>CS 352, Winter 2014, Dr. Burnett
<br>HW #1: Design principles
</h1><h1>
</h1><h2>Due: see main class web page
<br>2-person group assignment
</h2>

<p>Your goal is to apply the design principles 
of visibility, feedback, constraints, consistency, affordance
from Section 1.6.3 to an existing piece of software.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select any software that already existed by December 31. Preferably 
something you have helped to write (eg, for a class or work), but 
commercial or open source software is ok too. 
It can have a very simple (eg, just ASCII q and a) or very complex user 
interface. Include one or more screenshots or sketches to be referred to
 below.</li>
<li>For each design principle in Section 1.6.3, provide a concrete 
example of how the software's UI supports that principle.  
Do this by referring to specific things on that picture.  Be sure to 
justify why you are saying that the example supports that principle (3-5
 sentences per principle). 
(If nothing about your UI at all supports a design principle, you can 
say so, but you might have to write a lot more to justify that.)</li>

<li>For each design principle, provide a concrete example of how the 
software violates that principle (with screenshot, justification, etc., 
as above). 
(If nothing about your UI at all violates a design principle, you can 
say so, but you might have to write a lot more to justify that.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Turn in hard-copy at the beginning of class on the due-date.</p>
<p><b>Tentative Grading Policy: </b> <br>
Here are the things considered while grading:<br>
1) The assignment requires examples for all the 5 design principles for full credit.<br>
2) Graded on a total of 20 marks, with 10 for providing examples of how 
the software's UI supports these 5 principles and 10 for how the 
software violates the same.<br>
3) It is necessary for you to provide a concrete example of how the 
software violates and supports the principle to get full credit. If the 
example doesn't clearly explain the violation of the design principle or
 if it does not explain how the software supports the design principle 
no credit is allotted.
